# Python Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects implemented in Python.

## [1. Rock Paper Scissors](./01.%20Rock%20Paper%20Scissors)

A classic game implemented in Python where the player competes against the computer in the timeless game of Rock Paper Scissors.

## [2. Hangman](./02.%20Hangman)

An interactive word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter before running out of attempts.

## [3. Caesar Cipher](./03.%20Caesar%20Cipher)

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. This project allows users to encode and decode messages using this classic cipher method. The program prompts the user for a message and a shift value, then applies the cipher to transform the text accordingly. Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt their messages, making it an engaging way to explore basic concepts of cryptography.
