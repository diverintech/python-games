# Python Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects implemented in Python.

## [1. Rock Paper Scissors](./01.%20Rock%20Paper%20Scissors)

A classic game implemented in Python where the player competes against the computer in the timeless game of Rock Paper Scissors.

## [2. Hangman](./02.%20Hangman)

An interactive word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter before running out of attempts.

## [3. Caesar Cipher](./03.%20Caesar%20Cipher)

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. This project allows users to encode and decode messages using this classic cipher method. The program prompts the user for a message and a shift value, then applies the cipher to transform the text accordingly. Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt their messages, making it an engaging way to explore basic concepts of cryptography.

## [4. Calculator Program](./04.%20Calculator)

This Python program is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two numbers and continue calculating with the result until the user chooses to exit.

## [5. Calculator Program](./05.%20Quiz%20Game)

This Python quiz game allows users to answer True/False questions from categories like General Knowledge and Science, with questions sourced from [the Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/). Players can track their scores and exit the game anytime by typing 'q'.
